# PROJECT TRAVELING SALESMAN PROBLEM

This project is an heuristic approach to the Traveling Salsman Problem. It was carried out as part of my final year of engineering school in the Mathematics for Machine Learning and Optimization module.
The final solution uses a KNN model to obtain groups of points and thus simplify the complexity by optimising the path first locally and then globally.

# Resources

In the project, first there are the instructions in "TP_Heur2023.pdf", then there is a notebook that explains the reasoning step by step named "Traveling_Salesman_Problem.ipybn" and finally a python file with all the code "Traveling_Salesman_Problem.py".

# Run the project

To run the project, you need to execute the python file (.py) and specify the path to the text file (.txt) containing the data.
There are 5 files of varying lengths in the folder; for example, you can enter the path "./Pb1.txt".
